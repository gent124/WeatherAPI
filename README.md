Acquiring Free API Key
======================
Next step is getting a free API key at Open Weather Map (https://openweathermap.org/api) API witch will help us make some call requests to the server and retrieve the weather infos.

Once the api key is in your hands, generate enviroments and go to enviroments/enviroments.development.ts and create API_KEY enviroment variables with the key provided.

Installing dependencies
=======================
After the downloading the repository head on to the project root folder and run the npm install command line.

Development server
======================
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Code scaffolding
======================
Run ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.

Build
======================
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.

Running unit tests
======================
Run ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.

Running end-to-end tests
======================
Run ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.
